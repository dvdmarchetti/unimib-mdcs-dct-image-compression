# Metodi del Calcolo Scientifico A.A. 2019/2020
Final project for "Metodi del Calcolo Scientifico" course.
The assignment is divided in two parts:

### Custom DCT2 Implementation
Implement the DCT2 algorithm without quantization and compare it with an open-source implementation which uses the FFT.
The code for this part is stored in the `custom-dct` directory.

### Image Compression GUI
Write a GUI program to load grayscale bitmap files and compress them with DCT2 based on two parameters: `F` (block size) and `d` (frequency limit).
Original and compressed image has to be shown side by side to allow an easy comparison.
